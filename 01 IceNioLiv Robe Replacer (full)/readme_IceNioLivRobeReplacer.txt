   1. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

*****************************************************************

To install the plugin, unzip the files into the Morrowind/Data Files
directory.  Say yes to overwrite should it ask.


*****************************************************************

     2. PLAYING THE PLUGIN

*****************************************************************

From the Morrowind Launcher, select Data Files and place a check
in the box next to the esp you wish to use. 

USE ONLY ONE ESP!!!! 

There are 5 esps included:
IceNioLivRobeReplacerALL.esp - For Morrowind and all the expansions
IceNioLivRobeReplacerMW.esp - for the robes in Morrowind only.
IceNioLivRobeReplacerTB.esp - for the robes included in Tribunal & Morrowind.
IceNioLivRobeReplacerBM.esp - for the robes included in Bloodmoon & Morrowind.
IceNioLivRobeReplacerPLUS.esp - Includes all the robes from all Morrowind and
                                    both expansions PLUS adds some robes to level lists.
                                    It's recommended to use a level list merger!

     3. Save Games

*****************************************************************

This plugin should not invalidate your old saved games, but you should
always make a backup prior to installing any new pluggin. If you save 
your game while this plugin is loaded, you may encounter error messages 
when you reload the saved game without the plugin. But you should be
able to continue on with the original game.

     4. Usage

*****************************************************************

My textures and Howndog's belong to us.  Same goes for any meshes we modified or
created.  If you want to use them, you must ask us first.

The models used in this pluggin are the property of the mesh maker.  You need to
contact them if you want to use their stuff.

If you need to contact me, I can be reached at my forum here:
